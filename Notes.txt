How to deploy our application
Heroku.com / AWS
Deloyment checklist
Dynamic Port Binding - Heroku tells us which port our app will use, so we need to make sure we listen to the port they tell us to
Specific Node Environment - We want to use a specific version of node and npm, so we need to tell Heroku which version we want
Specify start script - Instruct Heroku what command to run to start our server running
Create .gitignore file - We don't want to include dependencies, Heroku will do that for us


First Time Deployment
1. Create Heroku account
2. Commit our codebase to git
3. Install Heroku CLI and Create App
4. Deploy App with Git
5. Heroku deploys project
    - heroku -v
    - heroku login
    - heroku create
    - git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/whispering-reaches-15916.git
    - git push heroku master
    - heroku open


Subsequent Deploy
1. Commit codebase with git
    - git add.
    - git commit -m "changed something"
    - git push heroku master
2. Deploy App with Git


// install nodemon
npm intall --save nodemon
// run nodemon dev
npm run dev
